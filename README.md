## Getting Started 

You will need Python installed on your system, along with the Pygame library. If you don't have Pygame installed, you can do it by running `pip install pygame` on your command line.

To start the game, run the Python script via command line or through your IDE.

## How to Play

The game is a two-player game. Your aim is to hit the ball with your paddle making the ball move to the opponent's side. If your opponent misses the ball, you get a point. The first player to score 5 points wins the match.

Each player starts with some special powers, which can be used to influence the game's direction. Powers are carefully limited, so use them wisely!
